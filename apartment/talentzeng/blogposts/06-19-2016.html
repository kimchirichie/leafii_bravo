<i>"Both! There are so many ways to win. There are people that became a professional althele by working
	their face off but has a little talent. And then there are people that have lots of talent that became
	successful with less amount of work. <b>The key is which bird knew themselves best.</b> 
	A bird with small wings is no different than a bird with bigger wings if it knew to get up earlier to learn to fly"</i>
