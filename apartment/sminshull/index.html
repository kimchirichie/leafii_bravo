			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					At Scarsin Corporation, I quickly learned to effectively use their software, Integrated Insight Environment (I2E).  Within a week of being trained in this advanced Microsoft-integrated software, I was developing a comprehensive introductory instructional guide for client education. In addition, I worked diligently on constructing, refining and reviewing financial reports that required extreme precision and attention to data integrity. Constantly juggling building multiple clients’ reports and manager tasks, I delivered impressive work and met all deadlines.  Multi-tasking, while working on complex, multi-level projects and delivering on deadline, is a task I excel at.

				<p>
					My exemplary communication skills have been carefully developed during my two years spent working in a retail setting at Blue Heron Books, an independent bookseller. This job experience allowed me to interact with my co-workers, customers, as well as international book authors and community professionals in a well-mannered, clear and concise way. This high-energy, entrepreneurial environment required me to multi-task constantly; I excelled at precision in balancing cash, honing sales skills to understand customer needs and make appropriate recommendations, and creating effective store displays and managing shipping/receiving.   With respect for resources, efficiency of processes was always my goal.

			<h3>Waterloo Nanotechnology Hydroponics Team</h3>

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					I am insatiably curious.  I strive to move toward new learning opportunities.  And so I joined the Hydroponics Team!  After completing  a significant independent study into the construction and variations between hydropic systems as well as their benefits, I collaborated to create the layout and material choices for the mobile hydroponics unit.  This research is ongoing.

			<h3>Waterloo Undergraduate Nanotechnology Conference, First Annual</h3>

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					After being chosen through a competitive application process to attend this conference of nanotechnology research and industry experts, I participated in an innovative "Think-a-thon" where I presented my results to my group. One speaker specifically inspired me to consider a new perspective and as a result, I re-worked a report immediately following the conference. Every opportunity is one to learn.

			<h3>Gold Level National Award Candidate</h3>
			<h5>Duke of Edinburgh Award</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">
				<img src="assets/DukeofEd.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					The Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award challenged me to set and achieve goals, over 24 months, in five areas: community service (120+ volunteer hours), skills (film-making, language, crafts, concert band playing alto sax), physical recreation, adventurous journeys and a residential project (attending National Music Camp of Canada).  I have volunteered in my school and community for many years, yet the award criteria challenged me to volunteer in unfamiliar settings and take on projects that I was unskilled at (like knitting!). I motivated myself to seek membership in the school band even though it was not open to students who were not taking music class.  I used this award to push myself to become accomplished in areas like pole vaulting, hurdling and curling. The final requirement was the adventurous expedition where I canoed 60kms into Algonquin Park, camping and carrying all the required supplies!

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Soccer is my passion, my physical outlet. I have participated at all levels of soccer (house league to rep) since I was five years old.  I have also coached two girls' teams and refereed for four years (Referee of the Year, 2014).   A highlight was training with the Canadian Women’s Olympic Soccer Team, summer 2014 as well at attending the Disney World Cup (2014) to compete against teams from the U.S.A., South America and Dominican Republic.

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					My dedication and determination on the track and on the field saw me rise to be a high-level hurdler and pole vaulter during high school.  I achieved goals from obtaining the Women's Pole Vault record (junior and senior) at my high school, to becoming a Provincial Top Ten Pole Vault finisher twice (OFSAA).  I recently retired with a personal best jump of 3m which gave me a national ranking at Pole Vault Canada as #61.</p>
