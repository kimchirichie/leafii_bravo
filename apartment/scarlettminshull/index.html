				<p>
					The fast-paced, dynamic environment at Blue Heron Books, an award-winning Independent book store, has taught me a lot about multi-tasking and prioritizing!  I have learned precision in cash-balancing, and perfected my organizational skills as I make recommendations to customers, receive and ship books, and create effective merchandising displays all simultaneously!   This entrepreneurial setting has helped me develop excellent communication skills through interacting with customers of all ages, fellow staff, community professionals, as well as visiting authors.

					As one of thirty teen girls chosen (from over one hundred applicants nationally) to attend the inaugural Bootcamp for Brains (2017), I was priviledged to attend an inspiring week of seminars and workshops with engaged, motivated teens from across Canada.  We were instructed and challenged by relevant industry experts, corporate representatives, as well as government officials.  The Arts of Finance, Leadership, Communication, Self-Branding and Risk were explored.

				<p>
					Our Uxbridge Fall Fair is an annual agricultural event for young and old and I am honoured to be a Junior Director, co-coordinating the Saturday Children's Contests (Ugly Bug contest, Pet Show, Nail Hammering contest, Doll and Teddy bear show).  In advance of the weekend event, I help choose the creative categories, seek sponsorship prizes from local businesses, and promote the contests.  Enthusiasm is essential on Fair weekend!  Running on schedule and ensuring all ages enjoy the activities and contests is something I excel at.  I am also a participant in the Fair Homecrafts competition and was Teen Division Overall Points Winner 2013 and 2014.

				<p>
					Having participated as a soccer player in the Uxbridge Soccer Club for 10+ years, I was excited to add the refereeing experience.  As a paid Youth Referee (2015, 2016), I oversee recreational youth soccer games (ages 8-14 years), and ensure safe and respectful play, following the FIFA regulations and rules.  Refereeing requires acute observation skills, quick decision-making abilities and patience and confidence when communicating with players and parents.  Entry Level Referee Clinic and examination was completed for membership in The Ontario Soccer Association.

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Caring for children in a safe and stimulating environment has been both challenging and extremely rewarding!  I have enjoyed caring for two children, aged 2 and 7, while keeping them engaged in an array of activities including physical games, quiet reading time and creative arts and crafts.  Babysitting has helped me hone my time management and organizational skills to ensure the time with the children is dedicated to meeting their immediate needs as well as ensuring a pleasant homecoming for the parents.

			<h3>Silver Award Candidate</h3>
			<h5>Duke of Edinburgh International Award</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">				
				<img src="assets/Duke.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					The Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award challenges me to set and achieve goals, over 12 months, in five areas: community service, skills (film-making, language, piano lessons/composition), physical recreation, and an adventurous journey.  I have volunteered in my school and community for many years, yet the award criteria challenges me to volunteer in unfamiliar settings (fundraising door to door for Heart &amp; Stroke) and take on new projects (composing original piano pieces to play at the Sunderland Music Festival). I am using this award to push myself to become more skilled in areas like dance (acro!), badminton, and tennis.  This summer I completed the adventurous expedition where I canoed 60kms into Algonquin Park, camped and carried all the required supplies!

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Participating in Ontario Nature’s Youth Summit (September 2015 and 2016) was an exciting opportunity to join a diverse group of youth leaders on the shores of Lake Couchiching for a weekend of exploration, discovery and education.  As a young naturalist, I am interested in the preservation of our environment by encouraging responsibility towards nature.  Engaging workshops allowed me to interact with professionals and learn more about delicate ecosystems and species.  My favourite workshops included: Medicinal Plants of Ontario, Help Strenghten the Ontario Environmental Bill of Rights (OEBR), and The Conservation Conversation.

				<p>
					Idetntifiying the need for an inclusive sports team which required little equipment and gave many students the chance to participate, I started a high school Ultimate Frisbee League this fall.  After getting school permission and enlisting a teacher's committment to supervise, I organized announcements and purchased Daredevil Discs from Ottawa.  Our first two sessions saw 18+ students participating.  We look forward to competing in divisional tournaments in Spring 2017!

			<h3>Senior Dancer</h3>
			<h5>Uxbridge Dance Academy, Uxbridge, ON</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">				
				<img src="assets/ballet2.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Dedication and determination has seen me grow into an accomplished dancer with The Uxbridge Dance Academy.  With over eight hours of dance instruction (ballet, pointe, lyrical, jazz, hip hop, tap, acro) every week, and additional practice time at home, dance is a primary focus in my life.  I have been privileged to dance with the Uxbridge Secondary School Dance Company (2014/15), and participate in three productions of The Nutcracker (various roles), as well as several competitions, dance choreography showcases, and many annual recitals.  Through dance, I  have learned to be a constructive collaborator and positive team member.  Dancing requires patience as every series of movements needs to be repeated endlessly to achieve the final (near) perfect result.  Dancing is my creative outlet and I find ways to incorporate it into other projects such as school projects and film-making.

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					I am excited to embark on a pilgrimage to Europe with thousands of Canadian students to tour historic battlefields of France and Belgium.  In preparation, we are connecting with the stories of WWI veterans and visiting with WWII veterans before tracing their footsteps over the beaches and battlefields of Europe.  I am inspired to learn more about the sacrifices made by our veterans and my place as a Canadian in the world.

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Working in our local book store helped me recognize an opportunity for youth.  Despite our vibrant literary community, we were lacking a year-long teen bookclub, so with the support of Blue Heron Books (quarterly bookclub meetings/refreshments) and enthusiasm from local teens, the Nightlights Teen Bookclub was established! Social media is used to communicate the book titles and bookclub meeting dates.  This bookclub provides a fun, social atmostphere where the only rule at meetings is to respect others' opinions.
