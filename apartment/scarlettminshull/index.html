					Our Uxbridge Fall Fair is an annual agricultural event for young and old and I am honoured to be a Junior Director, co-coordinating the Saturday Children's Contests (Ugly Bug contest, Pet Show, Nail Hammering contest, Doll and Teddy bear show).  In advance of the weekend event, I help choose the creative categories, seek sponsorship prizes from local businesses, and promote the contests.  Enthusiasm is essential on Fair weekend!  Running on schedule and ensuring all ages enjoy the activities and contests is something I excel at.  I am also a participant in the Fair Homecrafts competition and was Teen Division Overall Points Winner 2013 and 2014.

					The fast-paced, dynamic environment at Blue Heron Books, an award-winning Independent book store, has taught me a lot about multi-tasking and prioritizing!  I have learned precision in cash-balancing, and perfected my organizational skills as I make recommendations to customers, receive and ship books, and create effective merchandising displays all simultaneously!   This entrepreneurial setting has helped me develop excellent communication skills through interacting with customers of all ages, fellow staff, community professionals, as well as visiting authors.

				<p>
					Having participated as a soccer player in the Uxbridge Soccer Club for 10+ years, I was excited to add the refereeing experience in 2015.  As a paid Youth Referee, I oversee recreational youth soccer games (ages 8-12 years), and ensure safe and respectful play, following the FIFA regulations and rules.  Refereeing requires acute observation skills, quick decision-making abilities and patience and confidence when communicating with players and parents.  Entry Level Referee Clinic and examination was completed for membership in The Ontario Soccer Association.

					Caring for children in a safe and stimulating environment has been both challenging and extremely rewarding!  I have enjoyed caring for two children, aged 2 and 7, while keeping them engaged in an array of activities including physical games, quiet reading time and creative arts and crafts.  Babysitting has helped me hone my time management and organizational skills to ensure the time with the children is dedicated to meeting their immediate needs as well as ensuring a pleasant homecoming for the parents.

			<h3>Silver Award Candidate</h3>
			<h5>Duke of Edinburgh International Award</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					The Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award challenges me to set and achieve goals, over 12 months, in five areas: community service, skills (film-making, language, piano lessons/composition), physical recreation, and an adventurous journey.  I have volunteered in my school and community for many years, yet the award criteria challenges me to volunteer in unfamiliar settings (fundraising door to door for Heart & Stroke) and take on new projects (composing original piano pieces to play at the Sunderland Music Festival). I am using this award to push myself to become more skilled in areas like dance (acro!), badminton, and tennis.  This summer I completed the adventurous expedition where I canoed 60kms into Algonquin Park, camped and carried all the required supplies!

			<h3>Intermediate Dancer</h3>
			<h5>Uxbridge Dance Academy, Uxbridge, ON</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">				
				<img src="assets/placeholder.png"/>
			</div>
			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Dedication and determination has seen me grow into an accomplished dancer with The Uxbridge Dance Academy.  With over eight hours of dance instruction (ballet, pointe, lyrical, jazz, hip hop, tap, acro) every week, and additional practice time at home, dance is a primary focus in my life.  I have been privileged to dance with the Uxbridge Secondary School Dance Company (2014/15), and participate in three productions of The Nutcracker (various roles), as well as several competitions, dance choreography showcases, and many annual recitals.  Through dance, I  have learned to be a constructive collaborator and positive team member.  Dancing requires patience as every series of movements needs to be repeated endlessly to achieve the final (near) perfect result.  Dancing is my creative outlet and I find ways to incorporate it into other projects such as school projects and film-making.
