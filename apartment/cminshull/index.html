I was able to design test and fully implement two software modules to make the software increasingly easier for the user and immensely more powerful at its job. Features added ranged from UI, serialization, data structuring, machine vision, procedural machine intelligence as well as communication and working with my team to deliver a seamless addition to the tool.</p>

				<div class="seven columns">
					<p>During my eight month term at the IQC, I was given the opportunity to take on my own research project, a task normally left for Ph.D students, while still in my undergrad. Over the eight months, I took an idea from my supervising professor to concept, then prototype, and finally a full implementation with conclusive publishable data. We sought to uncover a previously unknown vulnerability in a commercial quantum cryptography platform and were successful. Tasks ranged from experimental planning, purchase and assembly of components and lasers, all the way to test automation and data analysis of results. This led me to the first author writing of a research paper which will soon be seeking publication.

					<p>As a data intern, I spent most of my time completing customer data integration and building query-able reports. I was able to implement methods of improving efficiency and automation into the daily tasks of the team. With help from IT, It was improved the overall productivity of my group of several full time employees by at least 100%. After being quickly promoted, I began working one-on-one with new client managers to keep them informed and train them to use our software tools. I also continued to work closely with the reporting and modeling managers to provide feedback on continuing to improve efficiency in new areas.</p>

				<h3>Residence Life Don</h3>

				<div class="seven columns">
					<p>As a residence life don, I have experienced a lot of very exciting and extremely testing situations. I am responsible for the community, building, and well-being of each of my 40 students daily, as well as the safety of the entire building's 320 students two nights each week. Planning successful events takes a lot of planning and feedback from the students to give them exactly what they want. Being a don can also be highly stressful and challenging when dealing with numerous mental health and social issues. I strive to use extreme care when handling emergency situations that require me to deliver first aid and interact with emergency services (police fire ambulance). This position requires energy and enthusiasm and has been very rewarding--new friendships with both fellow dons and students. Also, friendships have resulted in many independent creative technological projects!</p>

					<p>I attended Waterloo's own Hack the North 2015 and joined a team of like-minded hackers to experiment with mobile application development. We created a cross platform mobile app called "Hype Social" designed to allow users to better access events, large and small, in their geographical communities. On Hype Social, a user can find: something to do in their area on a day off, see which friends are attending tomorrow's house party, and how much "Hype" the party has.</p>

				<div class="seven columns">
					<p>By completing the Maximize Potential Award in my first year at Waterloo, I was able to learn more about myself and what it takes to be a leader. These skills were part of the foundation that led me to later become a residence don. As a don I was so passionate about sharing the MaxPot program with future students that I became a presenter, leading structured workshops on personal development and creating my own program for the AMPED leadership conference. At the recent Fall 2015 AMPED workshop, I delivered my presentation to the next wave of student leaders and received outstanding reviews.</p>
