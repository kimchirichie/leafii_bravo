					<h5 class="quoteName">Pylori is a microaerophilic bacterium usually found in the stomach. Microaerophile is a microorganism that requires oxygen to survive, but requires environments containing lower levels of oxygen than are present in the atmosphere. It is present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. Once the bacteria has done enough damage. The acid can get through the lining of the stomach which leads to ulcers. May lead to bleeding, infections, or move through your digestive tract.</h5>

						<p>Alcohol – enhances the production of more stomach acid.</p>
						<p> Caffeine – increases the amount of stomach acid and the concentration level.</p>
						 <p> Smoking - increases the acidity of the small intestine and produces an environment for H. Pylori infection. Smoking constricts the small blood vessels in the stomach reducing blood flow. Prolonged behavior will lead to damage of stomach.</p>
						 <p> NSAIDS – a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. If drugs such as NSAIDS are used for a prolonged period it may damage the lining of the digestive tract, causing an ulcer, or intensify the existing ulcer. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen.</p>
						 <p> Zollinger -Ellison syndrome – is a rare condition in which one or more tumors form in your pancreas or the first part of the small intestine. This results to your stomach producing of more stomach acid. Zollinger or Ellison syndrome may result in acid reflux and heartburn. </p>
						 <p> Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD, Acid Reflux) – due to poor closure of the lower esophageal sphincter stomach contents come back up into the esophagus resulting in either symptoms or complications. Simply put, the mucus lining as the stomach does not to protect you from stomach acid.</p>
						<p> Ulcerative colitis - is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).it result in prolonged inflammation in your digestive tract and affects the inner lining of your large intestine (colon).</p>

			 <p>The doctor may suggest one of two methods. Medication or surgery.

					<p>Some ulcers cause scarring or swelling and block the opening into the small intestine. This may cause vomiting. Sensation of fullness leading to decreased appetite. With the decrease in appetite. Your body may not get enough nutrients and may also result in weight loss. </p>
					<p> The small intestines are roughly 7 meters long. The function of the small intestine is too absorb the nutrients from the chyme. Lining of intestinal walls has finger like projections call villi, to increase surface area. The villi are covered in microvilli which further increase surface area. Villi have a huge blood supply. Microvilli are responsible the absorption of the nutrients. These microvilli are extremely small allowing the nutrients from the food pass into the blood stream. When ulcers occur in the small intestines, the villi and microvilli are impaired, not allowing the absorption nutrients from chyme.</p>
					<p> inflammation of the small intestine causes difficulty with absorbing nutrients from the diet. The small intestine lining is covered by millions of villi , finger-like projections, which act to increase the surface area of the intestine allowing increased absorption of nutrients. The villi are damaged by the inflammation in CD, which results in a decrease in the absorption of food. </p>

					<p>Antibiotic medications to kill H. pylori. If H. pylori is found in your digestive tract, your doctor may recommend a combination of antibiotics to kill the bacterium. These may include amoxicillin (Amoxil), clarithromycin (Biaxin), metronidazole (Flagyl), tinidazole (Tindamax), tetracycline (Tetracycline HCL) and levofloxacin (Levaquin).</p>
					<p> Medications that block acid production and promote healing. Reduce stomach acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. These drugs include the prescription medications such as omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), esomeprazole (Nexium) and pantoprazole (Protonix). </p>
					<p> medications to reduce acid production. Acid blockers reduce the amount of stomach acid released into your digestive tract. Slowly relieves ulcer pain and enhances healing. </p>
					<p>Antacids a substance which neutralizes stomach acidity. Antacids neutralize existing stomach acid and can provide rapid pain relief. Antacids are avoided due to the Side effects, but may be prescribed. </p>

					<p>People of any age can suffer from ulcers.</p>
					<p>Women are just as prone to stomach ulcers as men are.</p>
					<p>Peptic ulcers will affect nearly 1 in 10 of all adults in Western countries.</p>
					<p>About 1 in every 20 gastric ulcers lead to stomach cancer.</p>
					<p>Duodenal ulcers may occur in adults of any age.</p>
					<p>Gastric ulcers affect mainly adults older than 40 years.</p>

					<p>#1 - Most doctors simply have no options other than antibiotic treatments when it comes to prescribing treatments for H. pylori infections. The prescription will almost always be either a Triple or Quadruple Therapy.</p>
					<p>#2 - Doctors cannot guarantee that their treatment will work, nor do they know that there is a clinically proven natural cure that does guarantee results.</p>
					<p>#3 - H. pylori is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatments.</p>
					<p>#4 - Thousands of ulcer sufferers have taken more than 4 courses of the same antibiotic treatment - yet they still have stomach ulcers and H. pylori.</p>
					<p>#5 - Approximately 65% of people infected with H. pylori are simultaneously infected with Candida Albicans, and they don't even know about it!</p>
					<p>#6 - The latest drugs being produced for the treatment of H. pylori are now being made more powerful in an attempt to be more effective - but sadly the negative side effects are not getting any better (this is the main cause of patients abandoning treatment.)</p>
