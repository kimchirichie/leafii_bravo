He is helping me learn grade 12 university physics in a whole new way, as he is able to help explain each question to me in full detail.

But more than that, through his own passion for the subject, Richard inspires me to see a deeper beauty in the material that I am learningâ€”to understand why we study the things that we do, and to explore ideas that are not limited to the confines of the curriculum."},
